# AGS.Dev – Portfolio Site

Live personal portfolio showcasing Gowri Sankar’s work, skills, and contact links. Deployed at **[allamgowrisankar0001.github.io/CSA-HTML-TASK-4](https://allamgowrisankar0001.github.io/CSA-HTML-TASK-4/)**.

## Overview

- Minimal multi-page site (Home, About, Projects, Contact) with a consistent header/footer and smooth typography-driven layout.  
- Highlights key projects (LMS portal, TODO app, Tasty-Bites, SkyCast, BookNest) plus a skills grid.  
- Provides quick actions to download the resume and reach out via email, phone, or social profiles.  

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for semantic structure  
- **CSS3** for responsive layout, grids, flexbox, animations, and hover effects  
- **Google Fonts** (Poppins, Orbitron, Playfair Display, Montserrat, Cinzel)  
- **Font Awesome** for iconography  

## Pages & Sections

- `index.html` (Home): Hero intro with role animation, short bio, CTA buttons for downloading `resume.pdf` and contacting via mail.  
- `about.html`: Profile photo placeholder with narrative on experience, focus areas, and a “Connect With Me” mailto CTA.  
- `project.html`: Project cards with carousel-style image wrappers, tech tags, detailed descriptions, and external links. Includes a skills section highlighting core technologies.  
- `contact.html`: Modern split layout with simple form fields (email/message) and social/contact circles for email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and phone.  

## Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html       # Home
├── about.html       # About page
├── project.html     # Projects + skills
├── contact.html     # Contact/social links
├── index.css        # Global styles and layout
├── photos/          # Project/gallery assets
├── resume.pdf       # Downloadable resume
└── README.md
```

## Running Locally

1) Clone or download the repository.  
2) Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or start a simple server (e.g., `npx serve` or `python -m http.server 8000`) from the project root.  
3) Navigate via the header to explore Home, About, Projects, and Contact.  

## Customization Tips

- Replace images inside `photos/` with your own assets; keep the same filenames or update the `src` paths in `project.html`.  
- Update links (resume, project anchors, socials, mailto, and tel) to reflect your details.  
- Tweak typography or colors in `index.css` as desired.
